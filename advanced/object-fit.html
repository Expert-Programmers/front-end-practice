<h1>All Values of The CSS object-fit Propert</h1>
<p>The <code>object-fit</code> property can have the following values:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>fill</td>
        <td>This is default. The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. If necessary, the object will be stretched or squished
            to fit
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>contain</td>
        <td>The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the element's content box</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cover</td>
        <td>The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. The object will be clipped to
            fit
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>none</td>
        <td>The replaced content is not resized</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>scale-down</td>
        <td>The content is sized as if none or contain were specified (would result in a smaller concrete object size)</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
